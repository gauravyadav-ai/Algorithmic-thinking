while encountring this problem you might think this is simple recursion and we will go 1 step at a time and keep decreading power by 1 
but how will u encounter long test cases.

for example take n =10000
Do u now think that the first solution that came to our mind is feasible ?

exactly answer is NO!

so what we do now ?
think pow(2,5)
how did u compute it in your mind ?

Did u do 2*2*2*2*2 ?
or something else ?

I did 2* pow(2,4)
and i knew pow(2,4)= 16 
so 16*2 =32 

This means we can short our problem in even powers reducing the steps 

what if n=even =4 so answer becomes pow(2,4) 

TO apply recursion we need a base case right ?
what would be the base case while dealing with powers ? exactly correct thought ----> n=0 we return 1

edge cases - what if n is negative
pow(x,-n) ----> 1/pow(x,-n)
thats it 

Congratulations we have an optimised solution.
